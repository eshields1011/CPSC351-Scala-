### Scala
###### By:  Irene Liu, James Romero, and Evan Shields

Scala (which stands for scalable language) is a programming language that could be considered an evolution of the Java programming language, as it was designed to incorporate the best features of Java while expanding on those strengths and remedying its weaknesses. Our group chose Scala because we have used a considerable amount of Java to program during our time in computer science. Naturally, the next step would be to study the modern successor of Java. Scala was developed by a German computer scientist named Martin Odersky and publicly released 15 years ago in 2004. It has been regularly updated since, with its most recent version being released on September 18, 2019. As a developer on both javac and Generic Java, Odersky modeled much of Scala after Java, and it even runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It also borrows many of the types and conventions found in Java.
	
Why use Scala over Java? One of the main draws of Scala is its namesake: its scalability. Scalability, in regards to a programming language, refers to how well the language can be “used or produced in a range of capabilities.” Scala accomplishes this by its utilization of both object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming, giving it both versatility and flexibility to the modern programmer. In regards to Java, Scala is rather concise in its construction and can use as little as a tenth of the code it takes to write the same thing in Java. It is interoperable with Java as well, meaning it can seamlessly work with not only the basic programs we created as coding newbies but also the plethora of existing Java code that makes the world work. In fact, many corporations all over the world have converted their outdated back-end Java code into the more modern Scala, including large companies such as Twitter, LinkedIn, The Guardian, and Sony.
	
Scala has many interesting features that distinguish it from Java aside from its obvious support of functional programming. One great feature is its concise language is: a class definition spanning over ten lines in Java can be shortened to a single line in Scala. Interestingly enough, import statements in Scala can be written in at any time and do not have to be clustered at the top. Variables can easily be declared immutable (val) or mutable (var). Similarly to Python, Scala uses the newline character instead of a semicolon to separate its statements. The default visibility in the Scala language is set to public.
	
Scala can handle any range of tasks that need to be fulfilled by a programmer, from short programs built for casual use or massive programs spanning thousands of lines of code that sustain multi-billion dollar corporations. Scala supports functional programming and numerous other features not found in Java, making it a superior modern upgrade over one of the most popular languages of the millennium. As its name suggests, the scalability of Scala will be its greatest asset for its relevance as time moves forward and the demand for better, more sophisticated code keeps on rising.
